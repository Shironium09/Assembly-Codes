# Assembly Language Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of **Assembly (ASM)** programs created for learning and practicing core assembly language concepts. The codes focus on fundamental operations such as arithmetic, looping, string handling, memory manipulation, and basic data transformations.

The programs are intentionally small and focused, making them useful for beginners who want to understand how low-level instructions work together to solve simple problems.

## 📌 Repository Overview

The assembly programs in this repository collectively demonstrate:

* Basic arithmetic operations (single-digit and multi-digit addition)
* Character and text output
* Looping and control flow
* String comparison and manipulation
* Array and row-based data rotation
* Data reversal (mirroring)
* Simple pattern or shape output

Rather than being a single application, this repository serves as a **practice set** or **learning archive** of assembly language exercises.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

* Strengthen understanding of low-level programming concepts
* Practice working with registers, memory, and instructions
* Build confidence in writing and reading assembly code

---

## 📈 Status

* Initial implementations completed
* Repository may be expanded with additional practice programs

---

This repository is intended for **educational use** and experimentation.
